## Problem Statement and Motivation

### The Challenge

Modern democratic discourse faces several critical challenges:

1. **Information Complexity**: Legislative documents are increasingly complex, often with intricate legal language that barriers public understanding.

2. **Limited Access to Analysis**: Professional legislative analysis is expensive and time-consuming, creating an information gap between policymakers and citizens.

3. **Debate Quality Decline**: Public discourse often lacks structured argumentation, evidence-based reasoning, and balanced perspective analysis.

4. **Civic Engagement Barriers**: Citizens struggle to engage meaningfully with policy discussions due to complexity and lack of accessible analytical tools.

### Motivation

Our motivation stems from the fundamental belief that informed civic participation is essential for democratic governance. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, we can:

- **Democratize legislative analysis** by making complex policy documents accessible to all citizens
- **Enhance debate quality** through structured, evidence-based argumentation
- **Improve civic education** by providing real-time access to Congressional data and analysis
- **Bridge the information gap** between policy experts and the general public

### Target Impact

DebateSim aims to:
- Increase citizen engagement in legislative processes
- Improve the quality of public policy discourse
- Provide educational tools for academic and professional settings
- Support evidence-based decision-making in civic contexts
